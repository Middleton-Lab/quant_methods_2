## This week

1. Types of response and predictor variables
2. Bivariate models and regularizing priors
3. Multiple regression and interactions
4. Drawing conclusions


## Why modular?

Rethink traditional statistical tests

- OLS, *t*-test, ANOVA, ANCOVA, multiple regression

as linear models with some combination of predictors

- Categorical or continuous?
- How many of each?


## Categorical or continuous?

Categorical:

- Shift the mean of the outcome (intercept)

Continuous:

- How much does the outcome change for a 1 unit increase in the predictor

. . .

*Interactions come later*

## Outcome: Birth mass

Possible predictors:

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
- Birth date
- Year
- Sex
- Maternal fecundity (nulliparous / primiparous / pluriparous)
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
- Maternal age
- Population size
- Temperature (min, max, avg)
- Rainfall
- ...
:::

## Categorical model 1

$$\textrm{Birth Mass} \sim Normal(\mu, \sigma)$$

$$\mu = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \textrm{Sex}$$

$$\beta_0 \sim Normal(3.5, 1)$$

$$\beta_1 \sim Normal(0, 1)$$

`Sex` can be coded `0` = Female and `1` = Male.

- $\beta_0$ is the female mean ($\beta_1 \times 0 = 0$)
- $\beta_0 + \beta_1$ is the male mean


## Categorical model 2

$$\textrm{Birth Mass} \sim Normal(\mu, \sigma)$$

$$\mu = \beta[\textrm{Sex}]$$

$$\beta[\textrm{Sex}] \sim Normal(3.5, 1)$$

- `Sex` is estimated simultaneously and separately for both sexes
- No added prior uncertainty for males


## Continuous model

$$\textrm{Birth Mass} \sim Normal(\mu, \sigma)$$

$$\mu = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \textrm{Population size}$$

$$\beta_0 \sim Normal(3.5, 1)$$

$$\beta_1 \sim Normal(0, 10)$$

- $\beta_0$: mean when population size = 0
- $\beta_1$: increase in birth mass for a 1 unit increase in population size
  - Scale the prior to the units of population size 


## Predictor types vs. analysis types

- ANOVA just a comparison of means for $\geq$ 3 groups
  - 1 categorical predictor with 3 or more levels
- *t*-test is just a comparison of means for 2 groups
  - 1 categorical predictor with 2 levels
  - A special case of ANOVA

Thinking this way will let you begin thinking about multiple regression a little easier.


## Is the estimate different from zero?

*Categorical*

- No difference in means (with 0/1 coding)
- Differences between posteriors (coming soon)

*Continuous*

- No change in $y$ for a 1 unit increase in the predictor
- Sometimes this is a true slope, sometimes just a continuous predictor
