@ARTICLE{Frank2011-xq,
  title       = "Measurement scale in maximum entropy models of species
                 abundance",
  author      = "Frank, S A",
  abstract    = "The consistency of the species abundance distribution across
                 diverse communities has attracted widespread attention. In
                 this paper, I argue that the consistency of pattern arises
                 because diverse ecological mechanisms share a common symmetry
                 with regard to measurement scale. By symmetry, I mean that
                 different ecological processes preserve the same measure of
                 information and lose all other information in the aggregation
                 of various perturbations. I frame these explanations of
                 symmetry, measurement, and aggregation in terms of a recently
                 developed extension to the theory of maximum entropy. I show
                 that the natural measurement scale for the species abundance
                 distribution is log-linear: the information in observations at
                 small population sizes scales logarithmically and, as
                 population size increases, the scaling of information grades
                 from logarithmic to linear. Such log-linear scaling leads
                 naturally to a gamma distribution for species abundance, which
                 matches well with the observed patterns. Much of the variation
                 between samples can be explained by the magnitude at which the
                 measurement scale grades from logarithmic to linear. This
                 measurement approach can be applied to the similar problem of
                 allelic diversity in population genetics and to a wide variety
                 of other patterns in biology.",

@ARTICLE{Frank2009-bd,
  title       = "The common patterns of nature",
  author      = "Frank, S A",
  abstract    = "We typically observe large-scale outcomes that arise from the
                 interactions of many hidden, small-scale processes. Examples
                 include age of disease onset, rates of amino acid
                 substitutions and composition of ecological communities. The
                 macroscopic patterns in each problem often vary around a
                 characteristic shape that can be generated by neutral
                 processes. A neutral generative model assumes that each
                 microscopic process follows unbiased or random stochastic
                 fluctuations: random connections of network nodes; amino acid
                 substitutions with no effect on fitness; species that arise or
                 disappear from communities randomly. These neutral generative
                 models often match common patterns of nature. In this paper, I
                 present the theoretical background by which we can understand
                 why these neutral generative models are so successful. I show
                 where the classic patterns come from, such as the Poisson
                 pattern, the normal or Gaussian pattern and many others. Each
                 classic pattern was often discovered by a simple neutral
                 generative model. The neutral patterns share a special
                 characteristic: they describe the patterns of nature that
                 follow from simple constraints on information. For example,
                 any aggregation of processes that preserves information only
                 about the mean and variance attracts to the Gaussian pattern;
                 any aggregation that preserves information only about the mean
                 attracts to the exponential pattern; any aggregation that
                 preserves information only about the geometric mean attracts
                 to the power law pattern. I present a simple and consistent
                 informational framework of the common patterns of nature based
                 on the method of maximum entropy. This framework shows that
                 each neutral generative model is a special case that helps to
                 discover a particular set of informational constraints; those
                 informational constraints define a much wider domain of
                 non-neutral generative processes that attract to the same
                 neutral pattern.",

                 Bayesian ideas already match your intuitions from everyday

                 of Bayesian data analysis are presented that illustrate how

                 elsewhere. We discuss prior distributions and explain how they
                 are not a liability but an important asset. We discuss the

                   the default, weakly informative priors used in all models
                   when the user does not specify the priors. Our approach is
                   to first deduce what the variances of the slopes would be if
                   we were instead to have defined the priors on the partial
                   correlation scale, and then to set independent Normal priors
                   on the slopes with variances equal to these implied
                   variances. Our approach is similar in spirit to that of
                   Zellner's g-prior (Zellner 1986), in that it involves a
                   multivariate normal prior on the regression slopes, with a
                   tuning parameter to control the width or informativeness of
                   the priors irrespective of the scales of the data and
                   predictors. The primary differences are that here the tuning
                   parameter is directly interpretable as the standard
                   deviation of the distribution of plausible partial
                   correlations, and that this tuning parameter can have
                   different values for different coefficients. The default
                   priors for the intercepts and random effects are ultimately
                   based on the prior slope variances.",

                 requires decisions about the specification of the appropriate
                 random-effects structure. Recently, Barr et al. (2013)
                 recommended fitting 'maximal' models with all possible random
                 effect components included. Estimation of maximal models,
                 however, may not converge. We show that failure to converge
                 typically is not due to a suboptimal estimation algorithm, but
                 is a consequence of attempting to fit a model that is too
                 complex to be properly supported by the data, irrespective of
                 whether estimation is based on maximum likelihood or on
                 Bayesian hierarchical modeling with uninformative or weakly
                 informative priors. Importantly, even under convergence,
                 overparameterization may lead to uninterpretable models. We
                 provide diagnostic tools for detecting overparameterization
                 and guiding model simplification. Finally, we clarify that the
                 simulations on which Barr et al. base their recommendations
                 are atypical for real data. A detailed example is provided of
                 how subject-related attentional fluctuation across trials may

                 non-significant results to guide conclusions about the status
                 of theories (or the effectiveness of practices). To know
                 whether a non-significant result counts against a theory, or
                 if it just indicates data insensitivity, researchers must use
                 one of: power, intervals (such as confidence or credibility
                 intervals), or else an indicator of the relative evidence for
                 one theory over another, such as a Bayes factor. I argue Bayes
                 factors allow theory to be linked to data in a way that
                 overcomes the weaknesses of the other approaches.
                 Specifically, Bayes factors use the data themselves to
                 determine their sensitivity in distinguishing theories (unlike
                 power), and they make use of those aspects of a theory's
                 predictions that are often easiest to specify (unlike power
                 and intervals, which require specifying the minimal
                 interesting value in order to address theory). Bayes factors
                 provide a coherent approach to determining whether
                 non-significant results support a null hypothesis over a
                 theory, or whether the data are just insensitive. They allow
                 accepting and rejecting the null hypothesis to be put on an
                 equal footing. Concrete examples are provided to indicate the
                 range of application of a simple online Bayes calculator,

                 have various advantages over simpler estimates of predictive
                 error such as AIC and DIC but are less used in practice

                 lay out fast and stable computations for LOO and WAIC that can

  author      = "de Villemereuil, Pierre and Wells, Jessie A and Edwards,
                 Robert D and Blomberg, Simon P",
  abstract    = "BACKGROUND: Uncertainty in comparative analyses can come from
                 at least two sources: a) phylogenetic uncertainty in the tree
                 topology or branch lengths, and b) uncertainty due to
                 intraspecific variation in trait values, either due to
                 measurement error or natural individual variation. Most
                 phylogenetic comparative methods do not account for such
                 uncertainties. Not accounting for these sources of uncertainty
                 leads to false perceptions of precision (confidence intervals
                 will be too narrow) and inflated significance in hypothesis
                 testing (e.g. p-values will be too small). Although there is
                 some application-specific software for fitting Bayesian models
                 accounting for phylogenetic error, more general and flexible
                 software is desirable. METHODS: We developed models to
                 directly incorporate phylogenetic uncertainty into a range of
                 analyses that biologists commonly perform, using a Bayesian
                 framework and Markov Chain Monte Carlo analyses. RESULTS: We
                 demonstrate applications in linear regression, quantification
                 of phylogenetic signal, and measurement error models.
                 Phylogenetic uncertainty was incorporated by applying a prior
                 distribution for the phylogeny, where this distribution
                 consisted of the posterior tree sets from Bayesian
                 phylogenetic tree estimation programs. The models were
                 analysed using simulated data sets, and applied to a real data
                 set on plant traits, from rainforest plant species in Northern
                 Australia. Analyses were performed using the free and open
                 source software OpenBUGS and JAGS. CONCLUSIONS: Incorporating
                 phylogenetic uncertainty through an empirical prior
                 distribution of trees leads to more precise estimation of
                 regression model parameters than using a single consensus tree
                 and enables a more realistic estimation of confidence
                 intervals. In addition, models incorporating measurement
                 errors and/or individual variation, in one or both variables,
                 are easily formulated in the Bayesian framework. We show that
                 BUGS is a useful, flexible general purpose tool for
                 phylogenetic comparative analyses, particularly for modelling
                 in the face of phylogenetic uncertainty and accounting for
                 measurement error or individual variation in explanatory
                 variables. Code for all models is provided in the BUGS model

                 ambiguities: Evidence from self-paced reading. Memory and
                 Cognition, 36(1), 201-216) presented evidence that the
                 so-called ambiguity advantage [Traxler et al. (1998). Adjunct
                 attachment is not a form of lexical ambiguity resolution.
                 Journal of Memory and Language, 39(4), 558-592], which has
                 been explained in terms of the Unrestricted Race Model, can
                 equally well be explained by assuming underspecification in
                 ambiguous conditions driven by task-demands. Specifically, if
                 comprehension questions require that ambiguities be resolved,
                 the parser tends to make an attachment: when questions are
                 about superficial aspects of the target sentence, readers tend
                 to pursue an underspecification strategy. It is reasonable to
                 assume that individual differences in strategy will play a
                 significant role in the application of such strategies, so
                 that studying average behaviour may not be informative. In
                 order to study the predictions of the good-enough processing
                 theory, we implemented two versions of underspecification: the
                 partial specification model (PSM), which is an implementation
                 of the Swets et al. proposal, and a more parsimonious version,
                 the non-specification model (NSM). We evaluate the relative
                 fit of these two kinds of underspecification to Swets et al.'s
                 data; as a baseline, we also fitted three models that assume
                 no underspecification. We find that a model without
                 underspecification provides a somewhat better fit than both
                 underspecification models, while the NSM model provides a
                 better fit than the PSM. We interpret the results as lack of
                 unambiguous evidence in favour of underspecification; however,
                 given that there is considerable existing evidence for
                 good-enough processing in the literature, it is reasonable to
                 assume that some underspecification might occur. Under this
                 assumption, the results can be interpreted as tentative
                 evidence for NSM over PSM. More generally, our work provides a
                 method for choosing between models of real-time processes in
                 sentence comprehension that make qualitative predictions about
                 the relationship between several dependent variables. We
                 believe that sentence processing research will greatly benefit
                 from a wider use of such methods.",

  abstract    = "Delaying the appearance of a verb in a noun-verb dependency
                 tends to increase processing difficulty at the verb; one
                 explanation for this locality effect is decay and/or
                 interference of the noun in working memory. Surprisal, an
                 expectation-based account, predicts that delaying the
                 appearance of a verb either renders it no more predictable or
                 more predictable, leading respectively to a prediction of no
                 effect of distance or a facilitation. Recently, Husain et al.
                 (2014) suggested that when the exact identity of the upcoming
                 verb is predictable (strong predictability), increasing
                 argument-verb distance leads to facilitation effects, which is
                 consistent with surprisal; but when the exact identity of the
                 upcoming verb is not predictable (weak predictability),
                 locality effects are seen. We investigated Husain et al.'s
                 proposal using Persian complex predicates (CPs), which consist
                 of a non-verbal element-a noun in the current study-and a
                 verb. In CPs, once the noun has been read, the exact identity
                 of the verb is highly predictable (strong predictability);
                 this was confirmed using a sentence completion study. In two
                 self-paced reading (SPR) and two eye-tracking (ET)
                 experiments, we delayed the appearance of the verb by
                 interposing a relative clause (Experiments 1 and 3) or a long
                 PP (Experiments 2 and 4). We also included a simple Noun-Verb
                 predicate configuration with the same distance manipulation;
                 here, the exact identity of the verb was not predictable (weak
                 predictability). Thus, the design crossed Predictability
                 Strength and Distance. We found that, consistent with
                 surprisal, the verb in the strong predictability conditions
                 was read faster than in the weak predictability conditions.
                 Furthermore, greater verb-argument distance led to slower
                 reading times; strong predictability did not neutralize or
                 attenuate the locality effects. As regards the effect of
                 distance on dependency resolution difficulty, these four
                 experiments present evidence in favor of working memory
                 accounts of argument-verb dependency resolution, and against
                 the surprisal-based expectation account of Levy (2008).
                 However, another expectation-based measure, entropy, which was
                 computed using the offline sentence completion data, predicts
                 reading times in Experiment 1 but not in the other
                 experiments. Because participants tend to produce more
                 ungrammatical continuations in the long-distance condition in
                 Experiment 1, we suggest that forgetting due to memory
                 overload leads to greater entropy at the verb.",

                   with a simple example that builds up the one-sample t-test
                   from the beginning, explaining important concepts such as
                   the sampling distribution of the sample mean, and the iid
                   assumption. Then we examine the p-value in detail, and
                   discuss several important misconceptions about what a
                   p-value does and does not tell us. This leads to a
                   discussion of Type I, II error and power, and Type S and M

                   have many advantages over ANOVA, like ANOVAs, setting them
                   up for data analysis also requires some care. One simple
                   option, when numerically possible, is to fit the full
                   variance-covariance structure of random effects (the maximal

                   Although it is true that fitting a model with only random

                 that gave rise to the Bayes factor for testing a point null
                 hypothesis against a composite alternative. In line with
                 current thinking, we find that the conceptual innovation - to
                 assign prior mass to a general law - is due to a series of
                 three articles by Dorothy Wrinch and Sir Harold Jeffreys
                 (1919, 1921, 1923). However, our historical investigation also
                 suggests that in 1932 J. B. S. Haldane made an important
                 contribution to the development of the Bayes factor by
                 proposing the use of a mixture prior comprising a point mass
                 and a continuous probability density. Jeffreys was aware of
                 Haldane's work and it may have inspired him to pursue a more
                 concrete statistical implementation for his conceptual ideas.
                 It thus appears that Haldane may have played a much bigger
                 role in the statistical development of the Bayes factor than
                 has hitherto been assumed.",

                 continue an experiment. In the context of ordinary
                 significance-testing analysis, optional stopping is
                 discouraged, because it necessarily leads to increased type I
                 error rates over nominal values. This article addresses
                 whether optional stopping is problematic for Bayesian
                 inference with Bayes factors. Statisticians who developed
                 Bayesian methods thought not, but this wisdom has been
                 challenged by recent simulation results of Yu, Sprenger,

                 stopping rule. Researchers using Bayesian methods may employ
                 optional stopping in their own research and may provide
                 Bayesian analysis of secondary data regardless of the employed
                 stopping rule. I emphasize here the proper interpretation of
                 Bayesian quantities as measures of subjective belief on
                 theoretical positions, the difference between frequentist and

                 in the past 50 years, there has been little consideration of
                 corresponding statistical techniques for their analysis. In
                 analyses with nonlinear models, unmodeled variability from the
                 selection of items or participants may lead to asymptotically
                 biased estimation. This asymptotic bias, in turn, renders
                 inference problematic. We show, for example, that a signal
                 detection analysis of recognition memory data leads to
                 asymptotic underestimation of sensitivity. To eliminate

                 assessing statistical evidence in data. Despite the advantages
                 of Bayes factors and the drawbacks of p -values, inference by
                 p -values is still nearly ubiquitous. One impediment to the
                 adoption of Bayes factors is a lack of practical development,
                 particularly a lack of ready-to-use formulas and algorithms.
                 In this paper, we discuss and expand a set of default Bayes
                 factor tests for ANOVA designs. These tests are based on
                 multivariate generalizations of Cauchy priors on standardized
                 effects, and have the desirable properties of being invariant
                 with respect to linear transformations of measurement units.
                 Moreover, these Bayes factors are computationally convenient,
                 and straightforward sampling algorithms are provided. We cover
                 models with fixed, random, and mixed effects, including random
                 interactions, and do so for within-subject, between-subject,
                 and mixed designs. We extend the discussion to regression
                 models with continuous covariates. We also discuss how these
                 Bayes factors may be applied in nonlinear settings, and show
                 how they are useful in differentiating between the power law
                 and the exponential law of skill acquisition. In sum, the
                 current development makes the computation of Bayes factors

                 not aware of the statistical peculiarities of the p value
                 procedure. In particular, p values are based on data that were

                 measures of evidence, such as effect sizes. The second is to
                 replace inference with Bayesian measures of evidence, such as
                 the Bayes factor. The authors provide a practical comparison
                 of p values, effect sizes, and default Bayes factors as
                 measures of statistical evidence, using 855 recently published
                 t tests in psychology. The comparison yields two main results.
                 First, although p values and default Bayes factors almost
                 always agree about what hypothesis is better supported by the
                 data, the measures often disagree about the strength of this
                 support; for 70\% of the data sets for which the p value falls
                 between .01 and .05, the default Bayes factor indicates that
                 the evidence is only anecdotal. Second, effect sizes can
                 provide additional evidence to p values and default Bayes
                 factors. The authors conclude that the Bayesian approach is
                 comparatively prudent, preventing researchers from
                 overestimating the evidence in favor of an effect.",

                 information from genes, parental effects, and different

                 phenotypic development. Over the past few years, researchers

                 developmental plasticity and developmental trajectories. Here,
                 we describe the merits of a Bayesian approach to development,
                 review the main findings and implications of the current set
                 of models, and describe predictions that can be tested using
                 protocols already used by empiricists. We suggest that a

                 development",
  author      = "Panchanathan, Karthik and Frankenhuis, Willem E",
  abstract    = "Sensitive periods, in which experience shapes phenotypic
                 development to a larger extent than other periods, are
                 widespread in nature. Despite a recent focus on
                 neural-physiological explanation, few formal models have
                 examined the evolutionary selection pressures that result in
                 developmental mechanisms that produce sensitive periods. Here,
                 we present such a model. We model development as a
                 specialization process during which individuals incrementally
                 adapt to local environmental conditions, while receiving a
                 constant stream of cost-free, imperfect cues to the
                 environmental state. We compute optimal developmental
                 programmes across a range of ecological conditions and use
                 these programmes to simulate developmental trajectories and
                 obtain distributions of mature phenotypes. We highlight four
                 main results. First, matching the empirical record, sensitive
                 periods often result from experience or from a combination of
                 age and experience, but rarely from age alone. Second,
                 individual differences in sensitive periods emerge as a result
                 of stochasticity in cues: individuals who obtain more
                 consistent cue sets lose their plasticity at faster rates.
                 Third, in some cases, experience shapes phenotypes only at a
                 later life stage (lagged effects). Fourth, individuals might
                 perseverate along developmental trajectories despite
                 accumulating evidence suggesting the alternate trajectory is
                 more likely to match the ecology.",

                 testing procedure and modeling approach inspired by the
                 delayed-estimation paradigm used in the study of visual
                 short-term memory (STM). Abstract or concrete colored images
                 were each followed by a remember (R) or forget (F) instruction
                 and sometimes by a visual probe requiring a speeded detection
                 response (E1–E3). Memory was tested using an old–new (E1–E2)
                 or remember-know-no (E3) recognition task followed by a
                 continuous color judgment task (E2–E3); a final experiment
                 included only the color judgment task (E4). Replicating the
                 existing literature, more ``old'' or ``remember'' responses
                 were made to R than F items and RTs to postinstruction visual
                 probes were longer following F than R instructions. Color
                 judgments were more accurate for successfully recognized or
                 recollected R than F items (E2–E3); a mixture model confirmed
                 a decrease to both the probability of retrieving the F items
                 as well as the fidelity of the representation of those F items
                 that were retrieved (E4). We conclude that intentional
                 forgetting is an effortful process that not only reduces the
                 likelihood of successfully encoding an item for later
                 retrieval, but also produces an impoverished memory trace even
                 when those items are retrieved; these findings draw a parallel
                 between the control of memory representations within working
                 and long-term memory.",

                 may destabilise these mutualisms by altering the costs and
                 benefits each partner incurs from interacting. Using
                 meta-analyses, we show a near ubiquitous decoupling in
                 mutualism performance across terrestrial and marine
                 environments in which phototrophs benefit from enrichment at

                 heterotroph identity, their dependence on phototroph-derived C

                 enrichment. Nutrient-driven changes in mutualism performance
                 may alter community organisation and ecosystem processes and

                 is a major concern for marine wildlife, and mostly worrying
                 for long-lived species like cetaceans, considering their
                 demographic characteristics (slow population growth rates and
                 low fecundity). In European waters, cetaceans are highly
                 impacted by this phenomenon. Under the Common Fishery Policy,
                 the EC 812/2004 regulation constitutes a legal frame for
                 bycatch monitoring on 5–10\% of fishing vessels >15 m. The aim
                 of this work was to compare parameters and bycatch estimates
                 of common dolphins (Delphinus delphis) provided by observer
                 programmes in France and UK national reports and those
                 inferred from stranding data, through two approaches. Bycatch
                 was estimated from stranding data, first by correcting
                 effectives from drift conditions (using a drift prediction
                 model) and then by estimating the probability of being
                 buoyant. Observer programmes on fishing vessels allowed us to
                 identify the specificity of the interaction between common
                 dolphins and fishing gear, and provided low estimates of
                 annual bycaught animals (around 550 animals year−1). However,
                 observer programmes are hindered by logistical and
                 administrative constraints, and the sampling scheme seems to
                 be poorly designed for the detection of marine mammal
                 bycatches. The analyses of strandings by considering drift
                 conditions highlighted areas with high levels of interactions
                 between common dolphins and fisheries. Since 1997, the highest
                 densities of bycaught dolphins at sea were located in the
                 southern part of the continental shelf and slope of the Bay of
                 Biscay. Bycatch numbers inferred from strandings suggested
                 very high levels, ranging from 3650 dolphins year−1
                 [2250–7000] to 4700 [3850–5750] dolphins year−1, depending on
                 methodological choices. The main advantage of stranding data
                 is its large spatial scale, cutting across administrative
                 boundaries. Diverging estimates between observer programmes
                 and stranding interpretation can set very different management
                 consequences: observer programmes suggest a sustainable
                 situation for common dolphins, whereas estimates based on
                 strandings highlight a very worrying and unsustainable
                 process.",

                 well as the population dynamics that result from their action.
                 There is little work, however, that quantitatively examines
                 the evidence for these strategies and resulting cultural

                 address this problem with a rich quantitative database from

                 dynamics of particular cultural variants are driven by a mix
                 of individual and social learning processes. Particular
                 players vary dramatically in their sensitivity to population

                 Few studies, however, have quantitatively assessed whether
                 similar patterns of phylogenetic and functional similarity

                 transmission and disease incidence. We studied the questing (=
                 host-seeking) behavior of blacklegged tick (Ixodes scapularis)
                 nymphs, which are the primary vectors of Lyme disease in the
                 eastern United States. Lyme disease is common in northern but
                 not in southern regions, and prior ecological studies have
                 found that standard methods used to collect host-seeking
                 nymphs in northern regions are unsuccessful in the south. This
                 led us to hypothesize that there are behavior differences
                 between northern and southern nymphs that alter how readily
                 they are collected, and how likely they are to transmit the
                 etiological agent of Lyme disease to humans. To examine this
                 question, we compared the questing behavior of I. scapularis
                 nymphs originating from one northern (Lyme disease endemic)
                 and two southern (non-endemic) US regions at field sites in
                 Wisconsin, Rhode Island, Tennessee, and Florida.
                 Laboratory-raised uninfected nymphs were monitored in circular
                 0.2 m2 arenas containing wooden dowels (mimicking stems of
                 understory vegetation) for 10 (2011) and 19 (2012) weeks. The
                 probability of observing nymphs questing on these stems
                 (2011), and on stems, on top of leaf litter, and on arena
                 walls (2012) was much greater for northern than for southern
                 origin ticks in both years and at all field sites (19.5 times
                 greater in 2011; 3.6-11.6 times greater in 2012). Our findings
                 suggest that southern origin I. scapularis nymphs rarely
                 emerge from the leaf litter, and consequently are unlikely to
                 contact passing humans. We propose that this difference in
                 questing behavior accounts for observed geographic differences
                 in the efficacy of the standard sampling techniques used to
                 collect questing nymphs. These findings also support our
                 hypothesis that very low Lyme disease incidence in southern
                 states is, in part, a consequence of the type of host-seeking
                 behavior exhibited by southern populations of the key Lyme
                 disease vector.",

              models to cognitive phenomena. This development has resulted from
              the realization that across a wide variety of tasks the
              fundamental problem the cognitive system confronts is coping with
              uncertainty. From visual scene recognition to on-line language
              comprehension, from categorizing stimuli to determining to what
              degree an argument is convincing, people must deal with the
              incompleteness of the information they possess to perform these
              tasks, many of which have important survival-related
              consequences. This paper provides a review of Bayesian models of
              cognition, dividing them up by the different aspects of cognition
              to which they have been applied. The paper begins with a brief
              review of Bayesian inference. This falls short of a full
              technical introduction but the reader is referred to the relevant
              literature for further details. There follows reviews of Bayesian
              models in Perception, Categorization, Learning and Causality,
              Language Processing, Inductive Reasoning, Deductive Reasoning,
              and Argumentation. In all these areas, it is argued that
              sophisticated Bayesian models are enhancing our understanding of
              the underlying cognitive computations involved. It is concluded
              that a major challenge is to extend the evidential basis for
              these models, especially to accounts of higher level cognition.

              requirements to ensure research integrity. These include
              prespecification of studies whenever possible, avoidance of
              selection and other inappropriate data-analytic practices,
              complete reporting, and encouragement of replication. Second, in
              response to renewed recognition of the severe flaws of

              from reliance on NHST to estimation and other preferred

                   Probabilistic programming languages make it easier to

                   with many options regarding constructing, evaluating, and
                   using these models, along with many remaining challenges in
                   computation. Using Bayesian inference to solve real-world
                   problems requires not only statistical skills, subject
                   matter knowledge, and programming, but also awareness of the
                   decisions made in the process of data analysis. All of these

               for sparse Bayesian estimation, but has previously suffered from
               two problems. First, there has been no systematic way of
               specifying a prior for the global shrinkage hyperparameter based
               on the prior information about the degree of sparsity in the
               parameter vector. Second, the horseshoe prior has the undesired
               property that there is no possibility of specifying separately
               information about sparsity and the amount of regularization for
               the largest coefficients, which can be problematic with weakly
               identified parameters, such as the logistic regression
               coefficients in the case of data separation. This paper proposes
               solutions to both of these problems. We introduce a concept of
               effective number of nonzero parameters, show an intuitive way of
               formulating the prior for the global hyperparameter based on the
               sparsity assumptions, and argue that the previous default
               choices are dubious based on their tendency to favor solutions
               with more unshrunk parameters than we typically expect a priori.
               Moreover, we introduce a generalization to the horseshoe prior,
               called the regularized horseshoe, that allows us to specify a
               minimum level of regularization to the largest values. We show
               that the new prior can be considered as the continuous
               counterpart of the spike-and-slab prior with a finite slab
               width, whereas the original horseshoe resembles the
               spike-and-slab with an infinitely wide slab. Numerical
               experiments on synthetic and real world data illustrate the
               benefit of both of these theoretical advances.",

  abstract  = "This paper reviews predictive inference and feature selection
               for generalized linear models with scarce but high-dimensional
               data. We demonstrate that in many cases one can benefit from a
               decision theoretically justified two-stage approach: first,
               construct a possibly non-sparse model that predicts well, and
               then find a minimal subset of features that characterize the
               predictions. The model built in the first step is referred to as
               the reference model and the operation during the latter step as
               predictive projection. The key characteristic of this approach
               is that it finds an excellent tradeoff between sparsity and
               predictive accuracy, and the gain comes from utilizing all
               available information including prior and that coming from the
               left out features. We review several methods that follow this
               principle and provide novel methodological contributions. We
               present a new projection technique that unifies two existing
               techniques and is both accurate and fast to compute. We also
               propose a way of evaluating the feature selection process using
               fast leave-one-out cross-validation that allows for easy and
               intuitive model size selection. Furthermore, we prove a theorem
               that helps to understand the conditions under which the
               projective approach could be beneficial. The key ideas are
               illustrated via several experiments using simulated and real
               world data.",

              introduction to Bayesian data analysis. The introduction is
              geared toward reviewers, editors, and interested researchers who
              are new to Bayesian statistics. We provide commentary for eight
              recommended sources, which together cover the theoretical and
              practical cornerstones of Bayesian statistics in psychology and
              related sciences. The resources are presented in an incremental
              order, starting with theoretical foundations and moving on to
              applied issues. In addition, we outline an additional 32 articles
              and books that can be consulted to gain background knowledge
              about various theoretical specifics and Bayesian approaches to
              frequently used models. Our goal is to offer researchers a
              starting point for understanding the core tenets of Bayesian
              analysis, while requiring a low level of time commitment. After
              consulting our guide, the reader should understand how and why
              Bayesian methods work, and feel able to evaluate their use in the
              behavioral and social sciences.",
