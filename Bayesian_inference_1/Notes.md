Sampling is not optimization

"...if prior information is available, you can use it, and, if not, Bayesian regression with weakly informative default priors still has the advantage of yielding stable estimates and producing simulations that enable you to express inferential and predictive uncertainty (that is, estimates with uncertainties and probabilistic predictions or forecasts)." Gelman et al. (2020), p. 16
