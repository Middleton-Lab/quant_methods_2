## What we cover and don't cover

Do:

- Examples of many scenarios where random sampling is useful
- Common cases you will encounter

Don't:

- Every possible use case

## Dual motivations for this module

1. Demystify the workings & philosophy of statistical tests
2. Empower you to explore and simulate your datasets
3. Allow you to set up tests of the questions you might have about a method

## Packages we will use often

- [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/) Data wrangling
  - tidyr
  - dplyr
  - etc.
- ??

## Useful Skillsets

- Statistical understanding
- Programming 
- Methods for parallel processing
