  title       = "Statistical significance for genomewide studies",
  author      = "Storey, John D and Tibshirani, Robert",
  abstract    = "With the increase in genomewide experiments and the sequencing
                 of multiple genomes, the analysis of large data sets has
                 become commonplace in biology. It is often the case that
                 thousands of features in a genomewide data set are tested
                 against some null hypothesis, where a number of features are
                 expected to be significant. Here we propose an approach to
                 measuring statistical significance in these genomewide studies
                 based on the concept of the false discovery rate. This
                 approach offers a sensible balance between the number of true
                 and false positives that is automatically calibrated and
                 easily interpreted. In doing so, a measure of statistical
                 significance called the q value is associated with each tested
                 feature. The q value is similar to the well known p value,
                 except it is a measure of significance in terms of the false
                 discovery rate rather than the false positive rate. Our
                 approach avoids a flood of false positive results, while
                 offering a more liberal criterion than what has been used in
                 genome scans for linkage.",

                 Approach to Multiple Testing",
  author      = "Benjamini, Yoav and Hochberg, Yosef",
  abstract    = "The common approach to the multiplicity problem calls for
                 controlling the familywise error rate (FWER). This approach,
                 though, has faults, and we point out a few. A different
                 approach to problems of multiple significance testing is
                 presented. It calls for controlling the expected proportion of
                 falsely rejected hypotheses-the false discovery rate. This
                 error rate is equivalent to the FWER when all hypotheses are
                 true but is smaller otherwise. Therefore, in problems where
                 the control of the false discovery rate rather than that of
                 the FWER is desired, there is potential for a gain in power. A
                 simple sequential Bonferroni-type procedure is proved to
                 control the false discovery rate for independent test
                 statistics, and a simulation study shows that the gain in
                 power is substantial. The use of the new procedure and the

                 to test the validity of a null hypothesis. Often, we test the
                 validity of more than one null hypothesis. If we fail to use
                 an appropriate procedure to account for this multiplicity,

                 conclusion[---]we are more likely to make a mistake. In
                 physiology, experiments that involve multiple comparisons are
                 common: of the original articles published in 1997 by the
                 American Physiological Society, ~40\% cite a multiple

                 for phylogenetic inference under the maximum-likelihood (NIL)
                 optimality criterion. Parallelization was accomplished by
                 assigning each ``individual'' in the genetic algorithm
                 ``population'' to a separate processor so that the number of
                 processors used was equal to the size of the evolving
                 population (plus one additional processor for the control of
                 operations). The genetic algorithm incorporated branch-length
                 and topological mutation, recombination, selection on the ML
                 score, and (in some cases) migration and recombination among
                 subpopulations. We tested this parallel genetic algorithm with
                 large (228 taxa) data sets of both empirically observed DNA
                 sequence data (for angiosperms) as well as simulated DNA

                 search-time improvement was nearly linear with respect to the

  abstract    = "We propose a new method for approximate Bayesian statistical
                 inference on the basis of summary statistics. The method is
                 suited to complex problems that arise in population genetics,
                 extending ideas developed in this setting by earlier authors.
                 Properties of the posterior distribution of a parameter, such
                 as its mean or density curve, are approximated without
                 explicit likelihood calculations. This is achieved by fitting
                 a local-linear regression of simulated parameter values on
                 simulated summary statistics, and then substituting the
                 observed summary statistics into the regression equation. The
                 method combines many of the advantages of Bayesian statistical
                 inference with the computational efficiency of methods based
                 on summary statistics. A key advantage of the method is that
                 the nuisance parameters are automatically integrated out in
                 the simulation step, so that the large numbers of nuisance
                 parameters that arise in population genetics problems can be
                 handled without difficulty. Simulation results indicate
                 computational and statistical efficiency that compares
                 favorably with those of alternative methods previously
                 proposed in the literature. We also compare the relative
                 efficiency of inferences obtained using methods based on

              microsatellite loci to investigate the demographic history of the
              Y chromosome. Instead of assuming a population of constant size,
              as in most of the previous work on the Y chromosome, we consider
              a model which permits a period of recent population growth. We
              show that for most of the populations in our sample this model
              fits the data far better than a model with no growth. We estimate
              the demographic parameters of this model for each population and
              also the time to the most recent common ancestor. Since there is
              some uncertainty about the details of the microsatellite mutation
              process, we consider several plausible mutation schemes and
              estimate the variance in mutation size simultaneously with the
              demographic parameters of interest. Our finding of a recent
              common ancestor (probably in the last 120,000 years), coupled
              with a strong signal of demographic expansion in all populations,
              suggests either a recent human expansion from a small ancestral

  abstract  = "[We describe a new computer program that combines evolutionary
               algorithm methods with a derivative-based, quasi-Newton method
               to solve difficult unconstrained optimization problems. The
               program, called GENOUD (GENetic Optimization Using Derivatives),
               effectively solves problems that are nonlinear or perhaps even
               discontinuous in the parameters of the function to be optimized.
               When a statistical model's estimating function (for example, a
               log-likelihood) is nonlinear in the model's parameters, the
               function to be optimized will usually not be globally concave
               and may contain irregularities such as saddlepoints or
               discontinuous jumps. Optimization methods that rely on
               derivatives of the objective function may be unable to find any
               optimum at all. Or multiple local optima may exist, so that
               there is no guarantee that a derivative-based method will
               converge to the global optimum. We discuss the theoretical basis
               for expecting GENOUD to have a high probability of finding
               global optima. We conduct Monte Carlo experiments using scalar
               Normal mixture densities to illustrate this capability. We also
               use a system of four simultaneous nonlinear equations that has
               many parameters and multiple local optima to compare the
               performance of GENOUD to that of the Gauss-Newton algorithm in

               studies of complex adaptive systems, ranging from adaptive
               agents in economic theory to the use of machine learning
               techniques in the design of complex devices such as aircraft
               turbines and integrated circuits. Adaptation in Natural and
               Artificial Systems is the book that initiated this field of
               study, presenting the theoretical foundations and exploring
               applications. In its most familiar form, adaptation is a
               biological process, whereby organisms evolve by rearranging
               genetic material to survive in environments confronting them. In
               this now classic work, Holland presents a mathematical model
               that allows for the nonlinearity of such complex interactions.
               He demonstrates the model's universality by applying it to
               economics, physiological psychology, game theory, and artificial
               intelligence and then outlines the way in which this approach
               modifies the traditional views of mathematical genetics.
               Initially applying his concepts to simply defined artificial
               systems with limited numbers of parameters, Holland goes on to
               explore their use in the study of a wide range of complex,
               naturally occuring processes, concentrating on systems having
               multiple factors that interact in nonlinear ways. Along the way
               he accounts for major effects of coadaptation and coevolution:
               the emergence of building blocks, or schemata, that are
               recombined and passed on to succeeding generations to provide,

  abstract  = "As the world becomes increasingly complex, so do the statistical
               models required to analyse the challenging problems ahead. For
               the very first time in a single volume, the Handbook of
               Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) presents an extensive
               overview of the theory, practice and application of ABC methods.
               These simple, but powerful statistical techniques, take Bayesian
               statistics beyond the need to specify overly simplified models,
               to the setting where the model is defined only as a process that
               generates data. This process can be arbitrarily complex, to the
               point where standard Bayesian techniques based on working with
               tractable likelihood functions would not be viable. ABC methods
               finesse the problem of model complexity within the Bayesian
               framework by exploiting modern computational power, thereby
               permitting approximate Bayesian analyses of models that would
               otherwise be impossible to implement. The Handbook of ABC
               provides illuminating insight into the world of Bayesian
               modelling for intractable models for both experts and newcomers
               alike. It is an essential reference book for anyone interested

  abstract = "We introduce an approach to revealing the likelihood of different
              population histories that utilizes an explicit model of sequence
              evolution for the DNA segment under study. Based on a
              phylogenetic tree reconstruction method we show that a Tamura-Nei
              model with heterogeneous mutation rates is a fair description of
              the evolutionary process of the hypervariable region I of the
              mitochondrial DNA from humans. Assuming this complex model still
              allows the estimation of population history parameters, we
              suggest a likelihood approach to conducting statistical inference
              within a class of expansion models. More precisely, the
              likelihood of the data is based on the mean pairwise differences
              between DNA sequences and the number of variable sites in a
              sample. The use of likelihood ratios enables comparison of
              different hypotheses about population history, such as constant
              population size during the past or an increase or decrease of
              population size starting at some point back in time. This method
              was applied to show that the population of the Basques has
              expanded, whereas that of the Biaka pygmies is most likely
              decreasing. The Nuu-Chah-Nulth data are consistent with a model
