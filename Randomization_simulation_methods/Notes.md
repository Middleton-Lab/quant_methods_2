### week 1
Idea behind monte carlo
Intro / Background / Prerequisites
Resources
Goals, concepts
Motivations
Example uses
Cautionary tales
ACF/CCF hummingbirds
Null models
What questions do we ask when we use statistics?
Intro to power
Problem set:
Give a data set that was generated from a null & ask them to visualize and summarize.
Some simple programming - pulling samples, assigning and tracking ids, loops and mapping


Sampling from data 1- better names
Simple designs & examples
As a method to answer - is this ok?
Conservative vs. anti-conservative tests
Ratios - as an example
Other methods
Jackknife
Bootstrap
Problem set: skills needed - loops, mapping, functions, seeds, tracking ids. Pulling out test statistics, Perform test on a dataset violating assumptions - standard, nonparametric, randomization
	
Sampling from data 2
Complex designs
Nesting, time series, levels, multivariate
Multiple testing and how many permutations, empirical fdr
Different ways to parallelize
Base R
furrr
Scripts that accept parameters, calling R scripts from bash scripts
Generality - cross validation
Problem set - parallel stuff, seeds, lewis
