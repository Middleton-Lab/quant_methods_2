## Outline
### week 1
Idea behind monte carlo
Intro / Background / Prerequisites
Resources
Goals, concepts

Motivations

What questions do we ask when we use statistics?
Null models

Main applications & Example uses

Cautionary tales
ACF/CCF hummingbirds


Problem set:
Give a data set that was generated from a null & ask them to visualize and summarize.
Some simple programming - pulling samples, assigning and tracking ids, loops and mapping

## Week 2
Sampling from data 1- better names

Bootstrap

## The General Procedure



Randomization
General workflow
Simple designs & examples
Show models slide
Randomization use cases


Other methods
Jackknife
Bootstrap
Problem set: skills needed - loops, mapping, functions, seeds, tracking ids. Pulling out test statistics, Perform test on a dataset violating assumptions - standard, nonparametric, randomization
CI jackknife same as CI on mean
hypoth test with jackknife

## Week 3	
Sampling from data sets: complex designs

Sampling from data 2
Conservative vs. anti-conservative tests
As a method to answer - is this ok?
Ratios - as an example

Complex designs
2 way anova, multiple regression
non
Nesting, time series, levels, multivariate
Multiple testing and how many permutations, empirical fdr
Different ways to parallelize
Base R
furrr
Scripts that accept parameters, calling R scripts from bash scripts

Problem set - parallel stuff, seeds, lewis


Sampling from data sets: decision errors and predicting new data

Generality - cross validation
False positive rate - empirical
Power simulations


Simulations 1

simulations to verify methods they have learned
simulating a biological null

Simulations 2
When the null needs to be simulated
Simulating data
Power
Problem set: assigned at start - use your own data to use one method from class - consult ahead of time with instructors
