# Notes

## Lectures

- possible threads throughout
  - anything is possible
  - what am i trying to show?
      - problem set where they need to figure out the answer to a sci ? with the plot

- Lecture 1.4 
  - go over some plots from link
  - a difficult decision with real uncertainty about what is best
  - no dynamite plots (with few exceptions)
  

- Lecture 3.1 
  - show where we are going - several high information plots 
    - e.g. TT plot with DEseq & RNAi
    
- Lecture 5.1
  - add eps as option

- Lecture 5.4
  - show them how to source a file with ggplot functions & themes 


## recording mistakes

- Lecture 1.3
  - go back to end of slide 15 to pick up again
  
- Lecture 2.1 
  - cuts in third section 
  
  
## Problem sets

### Week 1

- Find a plot that you think is terrible
  - Explain why
- Read Midway SR. 2020. Principles of Effective Data Visualization. Patterns 1:100141.

### Week 2

- Experience working inside and outside aes()
- changing axis limits - when you get warning about dropping points

### Week 3

### Week 4

### Week 5

## Final project

- 4-6 publication quality images
  - Paper/manuscript/dissertation: multipanel labeled
  - Powerpoint slide: appropriate font and geometry sizes
    - Appropriate alt text
