1. Planning plots for publication
2. Font/point/line size
3. Complex plot operations
4. Reproducible visualization


## Planning for public consumption

*Manuscripts*:

- Don't let the journal resize your figures
- Determine the column and page dimensions of your intended journal
- You might have to reformat figures for a different journal

*Presentations*:

- Don't present talks or posters with microtext.


## Manuscripts

Print a page at 100% (no "fit-to-page"). Measure with a ruler.

## Plan for figure dimensions

- Single column: long figures / panels
- Two column: wide figures / panels

How does your eye move around the figure?

- Left to right
- Top to bottom


## Scaling

Everything in a figure needs to be readable

- Text
- Labels
- Lines
- Colors and gradients


## Figure output

Use vector output (pdf, svg, eps, wmf [Windows]) for as long as possible.

- `ggsave()`
  - `width`, `height`
- `cowplot::save_plot()`
  - `base_width`, `base_height`
  - Works well with `plot_grid()`
  - Adjust figure aspect ratio
