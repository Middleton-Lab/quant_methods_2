1. Planning plots for publication
2. Font/point/line size
3. Complex plot operations
4. Reproducible visualization


## Planning for public consumption

*Manuscripts*:

- Don't let the journal resize your figures
- Determine the column and page dimensions of your intended journal
- You might have to reformat figures for a different journal

*Presentations*:

- Don't present talks or posters with microtext.


## Manuscripts

Print a page at 100% (no enlargement). Measure with a ruler.

## Plan for figure dimensions

1. Single column: long figures / panels
2. Two column: wide figures / panels

How does your eye move around the figure


## Scaling

Everything in a figure needs to be readable

- Text
- Labels
- Lines
- Colors and gradients
