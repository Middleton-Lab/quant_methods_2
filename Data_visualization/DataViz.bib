  abstract    = "Interval estimates - estimates of parameters that include an
                 allowance for sampling uncertainty - have long been touted as
                 a key component of statistical analyses. There are several
                 kinds of interval estimates, but the most popular are
                 confidence intervals (CIs): intervals that contain the true
                 parameter value in some known proportion of repeated samples,
                 on average. The width of confidence intervals is thought to
                 index the precision of an estimate; CIs are thought to be a
                 guide to which parameter values are plausible or reasonable;
                 and the confidence coefficient of the interval (e.g., 95 \%)
                 is thought to index the plausibility that the true parameter
                 is included in the interval. We show in a number of examples
                 that CIs do not necessarily have any of these properties, and
                 can lead to unjustified or arbitrary inferences. For this
                 reason, we caution against relying upon confidence interval
                 theory to justify interval estimates, and suggest that other
                 theories of interval estimation should be used instead.",
