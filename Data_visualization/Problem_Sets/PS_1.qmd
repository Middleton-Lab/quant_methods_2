## Important packages you will need for this course

The following are packages you will need for this class: 
  - tidyverse
  - cowplot
  - patchwork
  - paleteer

Install these packages using `install.packages()` in the R console (e.g. `install.packages("tidyverse", dep = TRUE))`. Remember you only need to do this once and then you will use `library()` to load them. If you already have these packages, update them to the latest version using the same `install.packages()` function.

Once the installations are complete, write your setup chunk below loading these four packages using `library()`. Also load the cowplot theme using the following: `theme_set(theme_cowplot())`. You will use this same setup chunk with some possible additions for most problem sets. Including the options for echo, message, and warning means it won't print anything from this part in the html output. 

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| message: false
#| warning: false

#[FIXME]
library(tidyverse)
library(cowplot)
library(patchwork)
library(paletteer)

theme_set(theme_cowplot())

```

## Lynx population size and hunting^[C Elton and M Nicholson. 1942. The ten-year cycle in numbers of the lynx in Canada. Journal of Animal Ecology 11: 215-244.]

Hudson's Bay Company is one of the oldest corporations in Canada. It still operates retail stores across Canada today but for much of history, it was a fur trading business. One of the animals targeted by fur trappers in the 1700's and 1800's was the lynx. The number of pelts obtained by the Hudson's Bay Company each year between 1752 and 1819 is in the `LynxPopulation.csv` dataset. Given the intense hunting, one might predict a decline in the population size over time. Read in the data and perform a linear regression predicting number of pelts by year using `lm()`.   

```{r}

LL <- read.csv("../Data/LynxPopulation.csv")

mod <- lm(pelts ~ year, data=LL)
summary(mod)

```

Summarize your conclusions regarding the effect of fur trapping over time on lynx population size. 

>

Let's construct a plot displaying the linear regression results. Plot pelt number versus year and use `geom_point` and `geom_smooth(method="lm")`. 

```{r}

LL %>%
  ggplot(aes(year, pelts)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = 'lm')

```

Do you notice anything in the plot that suggests there might be an issue with using linear regression to analyze these data?

>

Because these data were collected over time, let's connect the points so we can see trends over time more clearly. Add `geom_line` to your plot to do this. 

```{r}

LL %>%
  ggplot(aes(year, pelts)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_line() +
  geom_smooth(method = 'lm')

```

Does connecting the points change your conclusions about the appropriateness of linear regression to address your question about population decline? Do you have any ideas of better ways to analyze these data?

>

If you had plotted the data as a first step, how do you think that would affect your conclusions?

2.
- What does this plot say? - What would you conclude? Different versions of a figure?

3. 
- here is a question. how would a plot show the answer?

4.
- Dataset 
  - plot that needs long format
  - plot that needs wide format

5. Separate or unite 

6.
- Dataset 
  - plot that reveals data problems
  - do some cleaning

7.
- Dataset
  - lots of geoms
  
8. find a terrible image from lit - explain why - give link
